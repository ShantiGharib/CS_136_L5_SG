* class definition style & standards:  first, member vars and do not forget to initialize them;  second functions: separate group of functions  by a blank line; either matching setter/getter pairs or list all setters back to back and list all getters back to back; start with default c’tor, followed by  copy c’tor (if any), then other c’tors in the order of increased number of arguments, d’tor- right after c’tor(s), overloaded functions- list them back to back in the order of increased number of arguments;  all accessor/getter functions should be const; all functions with more than one statement should be normal (defined externally), no inline functions with more than one statement; initialize all member variables to appropriate default values at the time of definition; all member variables must be private; classes must provide a strong exception guarantee; must have default c’tor; implement Rule of Three when necessary
